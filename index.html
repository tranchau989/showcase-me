      <h2><a href="https://github.com/tranchau989/Snapshot_AcousticImpedance_Prediction" target="_blank">Project One: Acoustic Impedant Prediction using Stratigraphy-guided Deep Learning</a></h2>
      This research presents a new method—Stratigraphy-Guided Deep Learning (SGDL)—for estimating acoustic impedance from poststack seismic data using deep neural networks. Acoustic impedance plays a key role in linking seismic reflectivity to subsurface rock properties, and accurate inversion is critical for reservoir characterization.

SGDL advances seismic inversion by incorporating stratigraphic units as an additional input feature, allowing the model to learn in a more geologically meaningful context. The approach leverages a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as the backbone architecture, which is specifically suited to capturing both temporal and spatial features in seismic data. TCNs process sequential information along the depth axis (time/depth domain), extracting subsurface trends and reflectivity patterns, while also integrating lateral information from neighboring traces. This dual capability enables the model to better understand local continuity and geological structures—key factors in inversion quality.
In a case study using the Volve dataset, SGDL was trained on well-controlled field data and benchmarked against traditional poststack inversion and other deep learning methods. The results demonstrate:
  <ul>
    <li>A ~10% improvement in Pearson Correlation on two benchmark wells.</li>
    <li>A ~20% average improvement across 10 test wells, showing strong generalization and robustness.</li>
  </ul>
Why this matters:
SGDL is especially effective in near-field exploration settings, where labeled well data and stratigraphic interpretations are available. By combining geological priors with a model capable of extracting rich temporal and spatial features, SGDL offers a robust and interpretable solution for seismic inversion.
